# python-chart-libraries
This repository shows a small analysis of 4 major python plotting libraries. 

- matplotlib
- plotly
- seaborn
- altair

The notebook has some example charts such as bar graph line graph and it compares code as how the same result will be achieved in different libraries. 

After each iteration of charts a comparison has been done to explain the changes that occured in the code. 

At the end a small summary of each library has been written which states its pros and cons. 

A table that shows the range of chart each library can produce and some brief findings.
